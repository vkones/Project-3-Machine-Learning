# Project-3-Machine-Learning



## 1. Business Understanding
- Stakeholder
- Business problem
- Why classification is appropriate

## 2. Data Understanding
- Dataset source
- Target variable
- Feature overview
- Missing values

## 3. Data Preparation
- Train-test split
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling (if needed)
- Leakage prevention

## 4. Modeling
- Baseline model
"The baseline Logistic Regression model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.82. This indicates a high level of performance in distinguishing between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. From a public health perspective, this score suggests the model is effective enough to be used for prioritizing outreach efforts. We can target individuals in the 'high-probability' bucket (the top 20% predicted by the model) to maximize the impact of our vaccination campaign."
- Tuned version of baseline
